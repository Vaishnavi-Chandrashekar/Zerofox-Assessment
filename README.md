# Problem background: Suppose that you are working as a data analyst at “Feel Like Home”(aka FLH) which is a home rental company like Oyo. For the past few months, because of covid, FLH has seen a major decline in revenue. Now that the restrictions have started lifting and people have started to travel more, the organization wants to make sure that it is fully prepared. The different leaders at FLH want to understand some important insights based on various attributes in the dataset to maximize revenue during this period of increasing travel:

What are the neighborhoods that FLH needs to target?

What are the pricing ranges preferred by FLH customers?

What are the types of properties that are most successful and least successful for FLH?

What are customers looking for most in their stays with FLH?

What attributes do the hosts have that FLH should target to add to their service to increase revenue?

How to get unpopular properties more traction?
